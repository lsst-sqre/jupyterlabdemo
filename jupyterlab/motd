Welcome to the LSST Science Platform Notebook Aspect.

Find useful documentation for the software and Notebook Aspect at:
        https://pipelines.lsst.io
        https://nb.lsst.io

The LSST Science Pipelines environment is in:

        /opt/lsst/software/stack

If you want to add your own configuration to LSST environment startup in the
LSST iPython kernel, create a sourceable shell fragment in:

        ${HOME}/notebooks/.user_setups

and it will be sourced during kernel startup.

To create an LSST environment in a terminal session and set up the full set of packages:

        source /opt/lsst/software/stack/loadLSST.bash
        setup lsst_distrib
